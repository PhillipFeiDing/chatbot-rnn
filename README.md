# Description
This NLP project builds a chatting robot cosisting of two parts. The mobile end (first part)is written in Java and holds an Android user interface that displays conversations and communicates between the user and a cloud server on the remote end. The second part is written in Python and trains a RNN to generate conversation based on users' inputs and respond to requests sent by the mobile end. The training has been done on the author's local computer with free corpus found on the web, and subsequently the model could run on the clould server to provide service to any user who has installed the mobile app. The model supports two languages, Chinese and English.
